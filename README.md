# V0-Raspicam-Mount
Thin &amp; sleek case profile for the pi camera, in addition to the mount 
- There are more cons than pros for this design.
- It is by no means a first layer inspector.
- This mount is designed for me to view current print progress when I am not near the printer or when I am outside of my house. (which means seeing the print not being detached or layers looking decent) 

## PROS / CONS
# [PROS]
-> Clear angle for prints

-> Allows tophat to be removed. Other mounts are on the tophat which will not be feasible if you want to print PLA or other lower temperature filament that requires tophat to be removed.

-> Cleaner cable management as it can fit underneath bottom deck panel

-> Mount allows swivel position, allowing other possible desired angles

# [CONS]
-> Appears blurry due to raspicam's 'un-focusable' lens. 

  --> (if you have a pi cam that can re-focus upon tuning this will be excellent)
  
  --> (you can also try to flood light to 'adjust' the focus)

-> Does not capture the whole print

-> Cannot see first 3-4 layers printed. This may vary on the thickness of your bed, as well as the hotend nozzle position.

-> Case of raspicam must is designed to be as thin as possible to avoid collision with toolhead, resulting in fragility.
